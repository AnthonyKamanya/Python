# Review Your Learning

In this section, you've worked towards 6 of the module's 10 learning objectives.

- Execute Ruby code in two different ways :point_left:
- Make a plan using problem decomposition and experimentation :point_left:
- Describe and use variables :point_left:
- Describe and use conditionals :point_left:
- Describe and use for and while loops :point_left:
- Describe and use lists
- Describe and use dictionaries
- Describe and use functions and methods :point_left:
- Describe and use classes

If a lot of these topics were new to you, it's very much worth taking 15 minutes to review them. Use the following questions to guide you and, if you get stuck, reach out to one of your peers – that will allow them to further test themselves.

1. Name two ways of executing Ruby code.
2. How are functions defined?
3. When would a method or a function take an argument?
4. What is the basic structure of an if statement?
5. What is refactoring?
6. What is the difference between for and while loops?
