# These challenges are a bit trickier and, in some cases, will required a few lines of code.  If you start to get a little stuck, take a step back and make a plan by breaking the overall task down into small steps.

# Just like the previous set of drills:
# Some of these functions require slice and control flow (square brackets and for loops!)


# when the string is apple
# the function should return true
# when the string is Apple
# it should return false
def starts_with_the_letter_a(string):
  # your code goes here (delete the pass keyword)
  pass

# when the string is Java
# the function should return true
# when the string is JAVA
# the function should return false
def ends_with_the_letter_a(string):
  # your code goes here (delete the pass keyword)
  pass

# when the string is 'hello world'
# the function should return true
# when the string is 'world'
# the function should return false
def contains_hello(string):
  # your code goes here (delete the pass keyword)
  pass

# when the string is 'hello folks'
# the function should return 'goodbye folks'
def substitute_hello_with_goodbye(string):
  # your code goes here (delete the pass keyword)
  pass

# when the string is 'hullabaloo'
# the function should return 'hllbl'
def remove_all_vowels(string):
  # your code goes here (delete the pass keyword)
  pass

# when the string is 'hullabaloo'
# the function should return 'uaaoo'
def remove_all_consonants(string):
  # your code goes here (delete the pass keyword)
  pass

# when the string is 'coding'
# the function should return 'cod'
def first_half(string):
  # your code goes here (delete the pass keyword)
  pass

# when the string is 'coding'
# the function should return 'ing'
def second_half(string):
  # your code goes here (delete the pass keyword)
  pass
